In Summer 2019, I worked on a math research project under Professor [Almut Burchard](http://www.math.toronto.edu/almut/), a Professor of Pure Mathematics at the University of Toronto. I worked on an open problem called Steiner Symmetrization in the field of Geometric Analysis. I wrote a fully-functioning Python Program to simulate the complicated symmetrization process, and provided valuable data insights about symmetrization. Here you can find the final report that I produced with some results and images from the data.
